		   <h6> Mobile Legends </h6>
                  <p class="card-text">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is one of the oldest MOBAs on mobile. In terms of sheer download numbers, it’s also the most popular. The game features five-vs-five battles, simple controls, ten-minute match lengths, and more. It also boasts 10-second matchmaking wait times, though that’s a bit exaggerated. Everything else is top-notch, though. Players who are disconnected can rejoin the same battle. That and more puts it right up there among the best MOBAs.</p>

		  <h6> Wild Rift </h6>
                  <p class="card-text">It has all the elements that people love in the original League of Legends: a map similar to Summoner’s Rift, almost the same set of champions, and equally challenging ranking mechanics. With all the things reminiscent of the original, Wild Rift also doesn’t fail to give players a new experience. The game is designed to be fast-paced and chaotic. It removes the Nexus that protects the base turret, so the game is expected to only last around 15-20 minutes, or even 10.</p>

  <h1 class="display-4">Hello!</h1>
  <p class="lead">I'm Rone Daniel Campañano. The motivation behind why I recorded these games is because they are a break from reality. In some cases it's ideal to put on the shoes of a made-up character and disregard every one of my issues. I realize that after I've had a hard day, I get back home and put on a headset and play a decent game; Adventure and experience games are my top picks since I get sucked into the game's reality and disregard everything around me. Another motivation behind why I love computer games is because they give me a feeling of achievement. The feeling you get when you complete a good game is a feeling that’s hard to compete with. It makes me feel important; like I have done something right.</p>
